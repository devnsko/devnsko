## 🎯 Current Focus

My main direction is bridging software, hardware, and human biology, preparing for future work in neuroscience and BCI.

## 🧠 Learning and Interests

Beyond programming, I'm expanding my knowledge in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics to build a solid foundation for my future endeavors in STEM, particularly in health-related technologies. 
I'm also learning German to broaden my horizons and embrace new opportunities.
